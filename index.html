      Welcome to Jhon's Zoo here you will find four very special animals that
      are very smart and powerful. First the Bear are omnivorous animals that
      eat practically everything and that although their sight and hearing are
      limited, they have a very good sense of smell with which they are able to
      detect a small trace of food for miles. They can be 2.80 meters long and
      weigh approximately 500 kilos. They tend to have dense, dark fur - except
      for polar bears and pandas - and strong claws on their limbs. Despite
      their clunky and slow appearance, they are very agile and stealthy when
      the need arises. The lion (Panthera leo) is a carnivorous mammal of the
      felidae family and one of the five living species of the genus Panthera.
      The exceptionally large males weigh up to 250 kg, making them the second
      largest living feline after the tiger (Panthera tigris). The gorilla is a
      mammalian animal that is part of the group of primates. It lives on the
      African continent, it can measure up to two meters in height and is
      characterized by having its arms much longer than its legs. The tiger is
      the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is
      most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a
      lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates
      such as deer and wild boar.
