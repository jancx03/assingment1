    <p id="description">
      Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as
      caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears
      are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats
      throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern
      Hemisphere.
