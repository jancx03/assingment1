      The lion is a large felid of the genus Panthera native to Africa and
      India. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round
      ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic;
      adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.
